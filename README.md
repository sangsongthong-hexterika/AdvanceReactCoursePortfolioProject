# Advanced React Course Portfolio Project

This project showcases my learning progress in React through the Advanced React Course on Coursera. It includes the original code provided by the course, which may contain outdated software versions.

## Project Intentions

This is my portfolio profile now.

## Disclaimer

The project includes original code from the Advanced React Course on Coursera, which may include outdated software versions due to the courseâ€™s timeline. The project may also contain the setup files within the Coursera lab setup. While I don't usually include these specific local setup files in the project repository, I have kept them to ensure I have all necessary setup files when submitting the course project to the learning platform.
