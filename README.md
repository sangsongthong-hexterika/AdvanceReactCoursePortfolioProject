# Advanced React Course Portfolio Project

This project showcases my learning progress in React through the Advanced React Course on Coursera. It includes the original code provided by the course, which may contain outdated software versions.

## Project Intentions

This project is currently being transitioned from a submission for Coursera's Advanced React Course to a personal portfolio profile. Initially designed to meet course requirements, it may contain placeholders or generic content.

I have decided to dedicate time over the next two weeks to transform this project into a fully personalized portfolio. This involves replacing any non-related details and placeholders with content that showcases my skills and work. The updates will be evident in the app's user interface, specifically in what is displayed after running `npm start`.

## Disclaimer

The project originally included code from Courseraâ€™s Advanced React Course, which may have outdated software versions. While these elements were necessary for course submission, I am now refining and updating the project to enhance its representation of my personal work.
