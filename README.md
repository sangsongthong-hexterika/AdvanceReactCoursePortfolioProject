# Advanced React Course Portfolio Project

This project showcases my learning progress in React through the Advanced React Course on Coursera. It includes the original code provided by the course, which may contain outdated software versions.

## Project Intentions

I intend to use this project to demonstrate my proficiency in React and Git as part of my learning journey. While I may not actively continue development beyond the course requirements, I aim to submit it as a portfolio piece showcasing my skills.

## Disclaimer

The project includes original code from the Advanced React Course on Coursera, which may include outdated software versions due to the course’s timeline. The project may also contain the setup files within the Coursera lab setup. While I don't usually include these specific local setup files in the project repository, I have kept them to ensure I have all necessary setup files when submitting the course project to the learning platform.
