# Advanced React Course Portfolio Project

This project showcases my learning progress in React through the Advanced React Course on Coursera. It includes the original code provided by the course, which may contain outdated software versions.

## Project Intentions

This is my portfolio profile now. 

Originally, I intended to just submit this project to Coursera's
Advance React Course only and be done with it. Now, things change. I decide to come back to work on it
and use it to reflect my own portfolio. This is the reason why there are some unrelated information
left on the project that are not my own things. 

I intend to gradually make changes to the information that is
displayed there from totally not related to me to be more and more personalized. 

I intend to finish cleaning up and taking the non-related information out of this project 
within two weeks from now. 

## Disclaimer

The project includes original code from the Advanced React Course on Coursera, which may include outdated software versions due to the courseâ€™s timeline. The project may also contain the setup files within the Coursera lab setup. While I don't usually include these specific local setup files in the project repository, I have kept them to ensure I have all necessary setup files when submitting the course project to the learning platform.
